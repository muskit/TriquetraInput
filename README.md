A VTOL VR mod that adds keyboard and joystick inputs.

Get it on [vtolvr-mods.com](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/b63xs5so/).

This mod is a continuation of [frdhog's original work](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/twr27qgs/). I'm not actively continuing work on this; I originally made the "sequel" with frdhog's permission to add a couple fixes. **However, I am open to checking out pull requests, so please feel free to contribute!**
